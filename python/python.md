# 3.2 Built-in data types</h1>
## 3.2.1 Numbers</h2>

<p>
Python's four number types are integers, floats, complex numbers, and Booleans:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Integers — 1, –3, 42, 355, 888888888888888, –7777777777 (integers aren't limited in size except by available memory)</li>
<li>Floats — 3.0, 31e12, –6e-4</li>
<li>Complex numbers — 3 + 2j, –4- 2j, 4.2 + 6.3j</li>
<li>Booleans — True, False</li>
</ul>

<p>You can manipulate them by using the arithmetics operators: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), ** (exponentiation), and % (modulus).</p>

Several built-in functions can operate on numbers. There are also the library module `cmath` (whitch contains functions for complex numbers) and the library module `math` (whitch contains functions for the other three types).

# 3.2.2 Lists

Python has a powerful built-in list type:

```python
[]
[1]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12]
[1, "two", 3, 4.0, ["a", "b"], (5,6)]
```
